# Start Here: Sound 79 Priority Plan

Given your resource constraints as a solo founder—**$50/month budget** and **3-5 hours/week**—focus on **high-leverage activities that compound over time** rather than trying to implement everything at once.

- Audio engineering degree + 20+ years pro audio experience
- Superior craftsmanship with faster turnaround and better pricing than competitors
- Existing Instagram presence
- Ideal customers: Large facility studios (75% of orders are $2,500+)

:::tip TL;DR (do these first)

- 🧱 Build your first website with 3 core pages (offer, proof, CTA)
- 🧩 Add an FAQ + basic schema
- ✍️ Publish 1 strong article/month and repurpose it
  :::

## 🧱 Week 1–2: Foundation (Build Your First Website)

### 1) Create 3 Essential Pages with AI-Optimized Structure

Don't build 50 pages—build 3 exceptional ones:

- **Custom Audio Cables** (product page) — XLR balanced mic/line level, multichannel snakes (8-32 channels)
- **About Sound 79** (trust page) — Your 20+ years experience, audio engineering degree, craftsmanship story
- **Case Studies/Portfolio** (proof page) — Photos of completed projects for studios

**For each page:**

- **Lead with a 50-word direct answer** to the main question someone would ask
- **Use question-based H2 headings** ("What cable types does Sound 79 offer?", "What are your lead times?")
- **Add 2-3 customer testimonials** with names and studio/company
- **Include clear pricing framework** — Base prices for common configurations + "custom configurations quoted"
- **One strong CTA** per page (Request Quote, Book Consultation)

**Sound 79-specific FAQ to include:**
- "What are your lead times?" → Answer: 1-2 days for simple jobs, 1-2 weeks for complex projects
- "Do you ship nationally/internationally?" → Yes, Sound 79 serves studios across the US and internationally
- "What makes Sound 79 different?" → Superior craftsmanship, faster turnaround, more affordable than Pro Audio LA, Sorry Cables, Redco, or Trace Audio

**Time:** 6-8 focused hours total

**ROI:** Creates online presence where none exists + AI visibility + trust building

---

### 2) Implement Basic Schema Markup

Add **FAQ schema** to your 3 core pages. This is the highest-ROI structured data for small sites.

Use Google's free Schema Markup Generator or a WordPress plugin like Rank Math.

**Time:** 1-2 hours

**ROI:** Dramatically improves AI visibility + helps Google understand your content

---

### 3) Set Up Google Business Profile (Service Area Business)

Sound 79 operates remotely but still benefits from GBP as a "service area business"—you don't need a storefront:

- Set service area to "Southern California" and optionally "California" or "United States"
- Complete every field (business category: "Audio Visual Equipment Supplier" or "Custom Cable Manufacturer")
- Add 10+ high-quality photos of your cable work and completed projects
- Request 5-10 reviews from past customers

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**ROI:** Immediate local search visibility + costs $0 + shows up when studios search "custom audio cables Southern California"

---

## ✍️ Week 3–4: Content That Does Double Duty

### 4) Write 2–3 "Pillar Articles" That Answer Common Questions

Focus on questions Sound 79's ideal customers actually ask. Based on your expertise:

- "Custom Cable Lead Times: What to Expect (1-2 Days to 1-2 Weeks)"
- "How to Choose the Right Cable Gauge for Studio Applications"
- "Balanced vs Unbalanced Audio Cables: When to Use Each"
- "Multichannel Snakes: Choosing Between 8, 16, and 32 Channels"
- "Why Custom Cables Beat Off-the-Shelf for Professional Studios"

**First article recommendation:** Lead times FAQ — this is the #1 question customers ask Sound 79

**Format for humans AND AI engines:**

- Start with a 60-word summary answer
- Use question-based H2s
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 lines
- Add FAQ schema
- Include real examples from your projects

**Time:** 3-4 hours per article

**ROI:** Works as:

- Organic SEO traffic generator
- Lead magnet (offer as PDF downloads)
- Email nurture content
- AI citation source
- LinkedIn post material

---

### 5) Repurpose Each Article Into 3–5 Formats

Don't create more—repurpose strategically. Since Sound 79 is already active on Instagram, prioritize there:

- Create **3-5 Instagram carousel posts** with key insights (your primary platform)
- Break each article into **3-5 LinkedIn posts** (secondary, for B2B connections)
- Record a **5-10 minute talking-head video** explaining the concept (phone camera is fine)
- Extract **quotes/tips for social media** throughout the month

One 2,000-word article becomes 15+ pieces of content across platforms.

**Time:** 30 minutes to repurpose

**ROI:** Builds cross-platform authority that AI engines value

---

## 🔎 Month 2: Strategic Visibility

### 6) "Sniper" Forum Participation (Keyword Alerts)

Instead of browsing for **30 minutes daily**, set up keyword alerts (using Google Alerts or specialized tools) for terms like "custom patchbay," "studio wiring help," or "cable noise issues."

Only jump in when someone has a specific problem you can solve. This cuts time down to **15 minutes/week** while targeting high-intent buyers.

- Reddit: r/audioengineering, r/recordingstudios, r/livesound
- Gearslutz forums
- ProSoundWeb community discussions

**Don't overtly promote**—provide genuinely helpful answers with your business name in your signature.

**Time:** 2-3 hours total

**ROI:**

- Builds backlinks
- Creates cross-platform authority signals for AI engines
- Generates word-of-mouth referrals
- Costs zero dollars

### 7) Get 3–5 High-Quality Backlinks

Focus quality over quantity:

- **Guest post on one respected audio blog** (e.g., Sound on Sound, Tape Op, ProSoundWeb)
- **Get featured in equipment dealer "resources" pages** (contact dealers who sell connectors/components)
- **Submit to audio equipment directories** (free listings on industry directories)

For guest posting: Pitch your pillar articles as expert contributions.

**Time:** 4-6 hours total

**ROI:** One quality backlink from a respected audio site beats 50 directory spam links

---

## 🤖 Month 3: Automation & Systems

### 8) Set Up a Simple Email Sequence (Free)

Use a free tier of email software (Mailchimp free up to 500 contacts, or Brevo free plan).

**Lead magnet:** "Studio Cabling Specification Guide" (PDF version of your pillar article)

**5-email welcome sequence:**

1. Deliver the guide + introduce Sound 79 (your experience, credentials)
2. Case study example (studio transformation)
3. Common cabling mistakes (educational)
4. Lead times and how to request a quote
5. Quote request CTA with testimonial

**Time:** One focused day to set up

**ROI:** Runs forever automatically. Email marketing delivers $42 ROI per $1 spent

---

### 9) Consider Live Chat Later (Optional)

**For now, skip this.** With limited time, a simple contact form works fine.

**When to add:** Once Sound 79 has steady website traffic, consider a free chatbot like Tidio trained on your FAQ content. But **restrict it to non-technical topics** (lead times, pricing ranges, booking).

**⚠️ Risk:** In high-end audio, a wrong technical answer destroys trust. Don't let AI hallucinate about "grounding schemes" or "impedance matching."

---

## 🔁 Ongoing (15–30 Minutes Daily)

### 9) Post Educational Content: Instagram 3x/Week + LinkedIn 1-2x/Week

**Instagram (primary):** Sound 79 is already active here—lean into it. Instagram works well for visual craftsmanship content and reaches studio engineers scrolling during sessions.

**LinkedIn (secondary):** B2B decision-makers (studio owners, facility managers) are here. Post less frequently but target these buyers directly.

**Content ideas:**

- Quick tips (cable coiling techniques, connector care)
- Behind-the-scenes photos of your work
- "Before & after" patchbay installations
- Technical explanations made simple
- Customer success stories (with permission)
- Lead time updates ("Currently booking 1-2 week projects")

Use your pillar articles as source material—extract insights and share them.

**Time:** 15 minutes per post

**Don't sell**—educate and showcase expertise. The right clients will reach out.

## 🚫 What NOT to Do (Time Wasters for Sound 79)

**❌ Don't post daily on every platform** — focus on Instagram 3x/week + LinkedIn 1-2x/week

**❌ Don't obsess over fancy design** — clear, fast, professional is enough

**❌ Don't try to compete on price alone** — emphasize craftsmanship, reliability, and faster turnaround

**❌ Don't ignore your existing word-of-mouth network** — ask current clients for testimonials and referrals
